# image-classification
Project from ["Udacity's Deep Learning course"](https://br.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101/)

## Project Goal
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.
